## Forms Tabstrip and Dir select


</div>

### Description

Two pre made forms (Tab Strip and a dir select) ready to put into your apps from the VB project window.

Form1 = 31 lines of code giving you a 6 window Tab form to start working with.

Form2 = 13 lines of code giving complete access to you file system with minimum code.

Just unZip to your forms file which by default would be somthing like

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Template\Forms" then launch VB and add a form you will find them their. Saves me ages, I do have other forms but will only add them if people vote for these. JP keep on coding.
 
### More Info
 
They are only forms with the min code and controls to get a basic app working. They must be put into your Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Template\Forms folder.
